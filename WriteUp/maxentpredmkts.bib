2 cases:
-without noise
there exists a true weight vector \mu that can exactly predict outcome.
wc loss 2(ln n - H(\mu)) i.e., at most 2 ln n
-with noise
there is an additional term \sum{over all rounds} (best approx predictor.x - actual outcome)^2------> this is N

previous strategies that won't work:
	previously people had used idea to consider everything below some constant as 0 loss 
	optimal algorithms for when exactly one expert's advice is best
	we can't just predict a vector consistent with seen examples (may achieve \Omega(n) wc loss)
	can't use wtd maj like approach where weight proportional to distance to prediction (an average of very high and very low may be accurate!)

strategy:
	change weights in accordance with how far algorithm's prediction was to true outcome
	to measure distance between alg wt vector and true(or approx true) wt vector use relative entropy (Kleinberg et al have also used this is sleeping bandits)},
