% Prediction markets have been known to perform well in practice (see, for instance, \cite{AGT07,Wol04,pennock2001real}). However, a sound theory for interpreting trader behavior and market prices is an ongoing area of study \cite{wolfers2006interpreting}.

% Scoring rules are a measure of merit of a predictor \cite{gneiting2007strictly}. \cite{hanson03} adapted scoring rules to markets with sequential participation of multiple traders. A cost function based formulation of markets was first introduced by \cite{chen2007utility}.

% Designing prediction markets to handle a large outcome space is an active area of research.  In \cite{Chen08}, the authors use a restricted betting language to design efficient markets for a combinatorial outcome space. This technique is generalized by \cite{Pennock11}. \cite{Gao09} consider extending various automated market makers to an infinite outcome space. For the logarithmic market scoring rule they show that unbounded market maker loss can result in this setting.   \cite{Abernethy11} and \cite{OthmanS11} specify frameworks under which they design cost function based markets that satisfy the desirable property of bounded market maker loss even in infinite outcome spaces.

% In this paper, we use exponential family distributions to construct our cost function. For a comprehensive introduction to the class of exponential family distributions see \cite{WainJordan08}. \cite{Azoury01} consider learning exponential family distributions in a traditional online learning model and provide worst case loss bounds relative to using an offline algorithm.  \cite{storkey11} constructs a prediction market where each participating agent is a learning algorithm with varying utility functions.
