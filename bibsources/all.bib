@article{chen2011information,
	title = {Information Elicitation for Decision Making},
	abstract = {Proper scoring rules, particularly when used as the basis for
a prediction market, are powerful tools for eliciting and aggregating
beliefs about events such as the likely outcome of
an election or sporting event. Such scoring rules incentivize
a single agent to reveal her true beliefs about the event.
Othman and Sandholm [16] introduced the idea of a decision
rule to examine these problems in contexts where the
information being elicited is conditional on some decision alternatives.
For example, {{\textbackslash}What} is the probability having ten
million viewers if we choose to air new television show X?
What if we choose Y?" Since only one show can actually air
in a slot, only the results under the chosen alternative can
ever be observed. Othman and Sandholm developed proper
scoring rules (and thus decision markets) for a single, deterministic
decision rule: always select the the action with the
greatest probability of success. In this work we signicantly
generalize their results, developing scoring rules for other
deterministic decision rules, randomized decision rules, and
situations where there may be more than two outcomes (e.g.
less than a million viewers, more than one but less than ten,
or more than ten million).},

	abstract = {Quantile assessments are commonly encountered in the elicitation of probability distributions in decision analysis, forecasting, and risk analysis. Scoring rules have been developed to provide ex ante incentives for careful and truthful assessments and ex post evaluation measures in the context of probability assessment. We show that these scoring rules designed for probability assessment provide inappropriate incentives if used for quantile assessment. We investigate the properties of a linear family of scoring rules that are intended specifically for quantile assessment (including the assessment of multiple quantiles) and can be related to a realistic decision-making problem. These rules provide proper incentives for quantile assessment and yield higher expected scores for distributions that are more informative in the sense of having less dispersion. We discuss the special case of interval forecasts and a generalization involving transformations, and we briefly mention other possible extensions.},

	abstract = {Let a person express his uncertainty about an event E, conditional upon an event F, by a number x and let him be given, as a result, a score which depends on x and the truth or falsity of E when F is true. It is shown that if the scores are additive for different events and if the person chooses admissible values only, then there exists a known transform of the values x to values which are probabilities. In particular, it follows that values x derived by significance tests, confidence intervals or by the rules of fuzzy logic are inadmissible. Only probability is a sensible description of uncertainty. ␥ Supposons qu'une personne exprime son incertitude à l'égard d'un événement E, qui est conditionné à un événement F, par un nombre x, et supposons qu'on lui assigne, comme résultat, un nombre s qui dépend de x et de la vérité ou de la fausseté de E quand F est vrai. On démontre que si les nombres s sont additives pour des événements différents, et que si la personne ne choisit que des valeurs admissibles, alors il existe une transformation connue des valeurs x aux valeurs qui sont des probabilités. En particulier, il en résulte que des valeurs x dérivées des tests de signification, des intervalles de confiance ou des règles de 'fuzzy logic' sont inadmissibles. Seule la probabilité est une description raisonnable de l'incertitude.},

A payoff function which depends on the assessor's stated probabilities and on the event which actually occurs may be used (1) to keep the assessor honest or (2) to evaluate the assessor. It is shown that with the exception of a logarithmic payoff function, these two uses of payoff functions for assessors are not compatible. This conflict is explained in terms of the differences in the situations facing the assessor and the evaluator (the user of the probabilistic predictions).},

It is well known that the conditional expectation E[X|Z] is the optimal L2 predictor (also known as “the least-mean-square error” predictor) of X, among all (Borel measurable) functions of Z. In this orrespondence, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the general loss functions under which the conditional expectation is the unique optimal predictor. We show that E[X|Z] is the optimal predictor for all Bregman loss functions (BLFs), of which the L2 loss function is a special case. Moreover, under mild conditions, we show that the BLFs are exhaustive, i.e., if for every random variable X, the infimum of E[F(X,y)] over all constants y is attained by the expectation E[X], then F is a BLF.}, number={7}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Information Theory}, author={Banerjee, A. and Guo, X. and Wang, H.}, year={2005}, month={Jul}, pages={2664–2669}}
